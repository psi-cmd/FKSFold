# FKSFold

FKSFold applies Feynman-Kac (FK) steering to guide the diffusion process in AlphaFold3-type models for molecular glue induced ternary structure prediction. This repository contains the implementation of our early approach that we explored before developing [YDS-GlueFold](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.23.630090v3), our more comprehensive and successful model for predicting molecular glue ternary complexes.


## Installation

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/YDS-Pharmatech/FKSFold.git
```


## Usage

Our usage is mostly compatable with the [Chai-1](https://github.com/chaidiscovery/chai-lab) repo. We removed the `num_diffn_samples` parameter in the `run_inference` function. You can reference to Chai-1's [README](https://github.com/chaidiscovery/chai-lab/blob/main/README.md) for more details.

### Command line inference

You can fold a FASTA file containing all the sequences (including modified residues, nucleotides, and ligands as SMILES strings) in a complex of interest by calling:

```shell
fksfold fold input.fasta output_folder
```

### Pythonic inference

```shell
python examples/predict_structure_fks.py
```
